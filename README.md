1. Why does this video/article interest you?

This video was interensting to me because I enjoyed the start-off of thee lesson. The author did not get right into the coding component of the topic. Instead, they used pen and paper to plan out their project. This helped me undertsnad what the video is going to. teach me about. By watching them brainstorm, I understood what the video is going to teach me and what I will learn from watching it. The author also used very simplified words when explaining the work they were doing. Therefore, the video became more understandable and i felt more engaged.

3. Given the date of publication, is it still relevant?

The video itself is 8 years old, but after what I have learnt in class, I believe the conntent has not changed, and the video summarizes what I have learnt soo far durinf lectures in class.

5. How do you know the author is credible?

The author is very professional and has a big page on teaching others about coding and tech. The video has gotten **2 million+** views and loads of positive comments. This makes me believe the author is very credible and the contetnt is correct.
